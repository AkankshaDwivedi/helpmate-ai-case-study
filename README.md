Build a RAG System

If you prefer a structured project with a clear starting point, you can build a project in the insurance domain, similar to the project in the module ‘Retrieval Augmented Generation with LlamaIndex’. The goal of the project will be to build a robust generative search system capable of effectively and accurately answering questions from various insurance policy documents. You may use LangChain or LlamaIndex to build the generative search application.
